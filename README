# Scala plugin for jEdit
Vlad Seryakov vseryakov@gmail.com

## Introduction

This plugin makes the development similar to C/C++ or other scripting environments,
i.e. it does not use any package manager or build tool. It assumes that all .jar
files are put in a pecial library directory manually. This is the simplest mode
of operation.

Of course, it is possible to specify custom directories and the classpath, and the plugin
will discover .jar files automatically. But because settings are currently global,
this means that if you switch between several projects very frequently, some kind of project specific
facility will make life easier. Currently, it requires to change paths manually for
every compilation, if it is different.

So, if you know all .jar files needed for your project, and they do not change often,
just copy then into Scala lib/ for example, which makes using the scala interpreter
less frustrating, because it loads all .jars from lib/ automatically.

See index.html for more information about installation and usage of the plugin.

## Features

- Scala syntax highlighting
- Embedded Scala compiler, results in very fast compilation
- Simple project strucutre convention, uses default directories
- Recursively adds all .jar files in the classpaths
- Recursively adds all Scala source files
- Supports Liftweb project development structure
- Embeds Jetty Web server for Liftweb development
- Embedded Jetty automatically scans for newly compiled classes
  and restarts Web server automatically
- Creates simple Liftweb application structure

See index.html for details

## Compilation and installation

### Requirements

* Java 8+ SDK
* Ant build tool
* jEdit source code
* jEdit build support files
* this plugins source code

You need the jEdit source code (of the version you want to compile the plugin for).
You can get the latest sources as an [archive from the jEdit website](http://jedit.org/index.php?page=download).

You will need to put this project and the jEdit source code
(in a directory with the name 'jedit') in the same directory, for example:

	~/src/jedit/
	~/src/scalac-jedit/

Then get the jEdit build support files:

	mkdir -p ~/src/jedit/build-support
	curl https://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/svn/HEAD/tree/build-support/trunk/plugin-build.xml?format=raw \
		> ~/src/jedit/build-support/plugin-build.xml
	curl https://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/svn/HEAD/tree/build-support/trunk/build-helper.xml?format=raw \
		> ../jedit/build-support/build-helper.xml

Then build jEdit:

	cd ~/src/jedit/
	ant

Then we can build our plugin:

	cd ~/src/scalac-jedit/
	ant

This will create ScalacPlugin.jar, including the Scala compiler, because the compiler requires
classes to be available during startup and compilation. Instead of using
bootstrapping, we just combine the Scala compiler and the Jetty server with our plugin,
and install into the local jEdit directory.
